            "The New 52 was the 2011 revamp and relaunch by DC Comics of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero comic books. Following
            the conclusion of the "Flashpoint" crossover storyline, DC cancelled all of its existing titles and debuted 52
            new series in September 2011 with new first issues.[1] Among the renumbered series were Action Comics and Detective
            Comics, which had retained their original numbering since the 1930s."

        <h1>DC Rebirth</h1>
        <p>
            "DC was a 2016 relaunch by American comic book publisher DC Comics of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero comic
            book titles. Using the end of The New 52 initiative in May 2016 as its launching point, DC Rebirth restored the
            DC Universe to a form much like that prior to the "Flashpoint" storyline while still incorporating numerous elements
            of The New 52, including its continuity. It also saw many of its titles move to a twice-monthly release schedule,
            along with being released at US$2.99. DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding in December 2017, opting to include
            everything under a larger "DC Universe" banner and naming. The continuity established by Rebirth continues into
            DC Universe."
